This is an updated version of the code that goes along with the article:

J. González, I. Rojas, H. Pomares, M. Salmerón, A. Prieto y J. J. Merelo. Optimization of Web Newspaper Layout in Real Time. Computer Networks, 36:311-321, 2001.

The article describes how to create an optimal layout for a random set of articles to fit into newspaper like columns, using an approach know as simulated annealing. Available, behind a paywall, at: <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138912860100158X>.

The original code that demonstrates the algorithm is online: <http://atc.ugr.es/~jesus/>. However, the JavaScript relies on the `<layer>` element which is not supported in contemporary browsers.
